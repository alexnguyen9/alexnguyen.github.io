Hey! Thanks for checking out my personal site.  I'm Alex and I'm a recent graduate from CSU Long Beach.

In the the past I've had the opportunity to work a variety of data, ranging from bus accident data from my time at Long Beach Transit, to working with massive amounts of healthcare data from my time at Strata Decision Technology.

This site hosts various projects that I've done in the past.

Questions? Concerns? Say Hello? Send anything and everything at my email: [alextnguyen9@gmail.com](mailto:alextnguyen9@gmail.com)
