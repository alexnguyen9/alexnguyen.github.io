Hey! Thanks for checking out my personal site.  I'm Alex and I'm a graduate student at Cal State Long Beach where I study statistics and aspire to become a data scientist.  In the the past I've had the opportunity to work a variety of data, ranging from bus accident data from my time at Long Beach Transit, to working with massive amounts of healthcare data from my time at Strata Decision Technology.  I've developed a strong background in statistics (been doing for undergrad and still going!), as well as really honing my programming skills (both in Python and R) within the last couple years).

This site various projects that I've done in the past.
