title: League Of Legends ARAM Match Predictor

### Background and Motivation

Within the popular game League of Legends, there is a game mode called ARAM (All Random All Middle). There are two teams with 5 players each, where all the players are given a randomly character from a set of 145 (as of patch 9.20) champions.  The setting of the map takes place in bridge where all the players duke it out all at once.

Lately I haven't been playing the regular summoner's rift match in League of Legends, rather opting for the ARAM map since it's faster and doesn't involve that much time investment.  Personally I find much more fun when you're constantly team battling instead of laning boringly for the 15 minutes summoners' rift. 

Of course since the characters are randomly chosen for each character, that got me thinking if you could predict which team would win given the team compositions of both teams.
