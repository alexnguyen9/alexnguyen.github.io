### Background and Motivation

Within the popular game League of Legends, there is a game mode called ARAM (All Random All Middle). There are two teams with 5 players each, where all the players are given randomized characters from a set of 145 (as of patch 9.20) champions.  The setting of the map takes place in bridge where all the players duke it out all at once.

Lately I haven't been playing the regular summoner's rift match in League of Legends, rather opting for the ARAM map since it's faster and doesn't involve that much time investment.  Personally I find much more fun when you're constantly team battling instead of laning boringly for the 15 minutes summoners' rift.
